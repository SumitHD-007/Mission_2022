            <p> I believe the greater your motivation, the greater your progress will be. A burning desire to reach
                your
                destination keeps you moving forward in spite of obstacles. Determination is an unstoppable force
                utilized by all successful people.
                Positive action moves you along. Taking action should be an automatic habit. Purge all excuses for
                not
                moving forward by replacing them with reasons to succeed. Since your thoughts program your mind,
                what
                you think about makes all the difference.
